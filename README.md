## 📖 Introduction

### Project Overview
**miniRT** is a minimalist ray tracing engine developed as part of the 42 school curriculum. This project introduces the beautiful world of computer graphics by implementing a ray tracer from scratch using the miniLibX graphics library.

### What is a Ray Tracer?
Ray tracing is a rendering technique that simulates the physical behavior of light to generate photorealistic images. The algorithm traces the path of light rays as they travel from a camera through each pixel in an image plane and calculates how these rays interact with objects in a 3D scene.  By simulating reflection, refraction, shadows, and lighting, ray tracing produces images with realistic lighting and shadows.

The basic ray tracing algorithm works as follows:
1. **Cast rays** from the camera through each pixel of the viewport
2. **Detect intersections** between rays and scene objects
3. **Calculate lighting** using ambient light, diffuse reflection, and shadows
4. **Render the final color** for each pixel based on material properties and lighting

### Key Features

**Mandatory Features:**
- 3D vector mathematics implementation
- Ray-object intersection algorithms for spheres, planes, and cylinders
- Phong lighting model with ambient and diffuse components
- Shadow casting for realistic lighting
- Scene file parsing (. rt format)
- Real-time rendering using miniLibX

**Bonus Features:**
- **(Bonus) Cone object** - Additional geometric primitive with apex-based intersection
- **(Bonus) Texture mapping** - Support for multiple texture types: 
  - Procedural checkerboard patterns
  - XPM image texture mapping (e.g., Earth and Jupiter textures)
  - UV coordinate mapping for spherical objects
- **(Bonus) Specular reflection** - Phong specular highlights for shiny surfaces
- **(Bonus) Adjustable shininess** - Configurable material shininess (2.0 - 200.0)
- **(Bonus) Multiple lights** - Support for multiple point light sources in a single scene

### Example Renders

Below are some example renders generated by miniRT:

> **Note**: Add your rendered images to showcase the capabilities of your ray tracer.  You can render scenes with different combinations of objects, lighting setups, and camera angles.

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

#### For Linux: 
- GCC compiler
- Make
- X11 development libraries
- miniLibX library

#### For macOS:
- Clang or GCC
- Make
- Xcode Command Line Tools
- miniLibX (included with the project or installed separately)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
# Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/yingzhan25/miniRT_42.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd miniRT_42
```

### Installation on Linux

```bash
# Install required dependencies
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gcc make xorg libxext-dev libbsd-dev

# Compile the project
make

# Run with a scene file
./minirt scenes/example.rt
```

### Installation on macOS

```bash
# Install Xcode Command Line Tools if not already installed
xcode-select --install

# Compile the project
make

# Run with a scene file
./minirt scenes/example.rt
```

### Using the miniLibX Library

The miniLibX (mlx) is a simple graphics library used for this project. It provides basic functionality for creating windows, handling events, and drawing images.

**Important Notes:**
- The library is already included or linked in the Makefile
- On Linux, mlx uses the X11 window system
- On macOS, mlx uses the native Cocoa framework
- Make sure the mlx header path in `includes/render.h` matches your system: 
  - macOS: `#include <mlx. h>`
  - Linux: `#include </usr/local/include/mlx.h>`

### Compilation

```bash
# Compile mandatory part
make

# Compile with bonus features (if implemented)
make bonus

# Clean object files
make clean

# Clean everything including executables
make fclean

# Recompile
make re
```

### Running the Program

```bash
# Basic usage
./minirt <scene_file. rt>

# Example
./minirt scenes/example.rt
```

### Controls
- **ESC**: Exit the program
- **Close window (X button)**: Exit the program
